Task title : Setting up the basic DNS server ( the core of the project ) and basic scraping 
One person We will implement a server based on GO language ( for more performance ) 
The other person will Implements website scraping using python that detects the key word 'tiktok' and return true or false .
Our basic DNS server should primarly block the resolution of tiktok.com .
The scenario we are willing to achieve 

Note:
We use GO to quickly process incoming DNS queries , and python to Analyze website content to decide if it should be blocked. 
Note: we should configure our machines to redirect the DNS requests to our script ( for the moment we are working on the level 
of machine , so we configure the machine to do that redirection , but in the final stages , we will configure all the network to redirect DNS requests to our Server ) 
Note (Facultatif): there is an idea of implement two servers : one based on python ( for simplicity and seeing the evolution of the project , also for testing next tasks ) .
if we did built two server with two languages , we will do a comparaison between the two scripts ( python vs go ) to add to the rapport .
